# IAV quantumSAR
IAV quantumSAR is planned as an AUTOSAR Cryptodriver with a collection of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for microcontroller presented by [IAV GmbH](https://www.iav.com/). The post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are based on the [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean) repository, which is a clean collection of the [NIST post-quantum project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography). IAV quantumSAR implements these algorithms to use them for automotive microcontrollers in an AUTOSAR Classic environment. The goal is to have a collection of various cryptographic algorithms for future automotive cybersecurity projects preparing for the upcoming computing power of quantum computers.

## Security Note
There was no security risk analysis like TARA or similar carried out for QuantumSAR. The post-quantum cryptographic algorithms itself were evaluated by NIST.

## Content
The base of IAV quantumSAR is the PQCleanAutomotive repository. It includes the following post-quantum cryptographic algorithms:

* CRYSTALS-KYBER

The following post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are in work:

* CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM
* FALCON
* SPHINCS+

## Implementation
For the integration of IAV quantumSAR, the file Crypto.c contains an example of the use of the CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm.

## AUTOSAR

QuantumSAR should supporting the AUTOSAR Version [R22-11](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/CP/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoDriver.pdf). 

## Patent
The Encryption PQC algorithm CRYSTALS-KYBER is one of the candidate algorithms for public-key post-quantum standards. There are two patent portfolios listed in a patent license agreement published by NIST.

Please check the license condition before any commercial implementation. IAV isnâ€™t owner, applicant, licensor or sub-licensor of the patent portfolios. It is any implementers sole responsibility to do the final license check for all implementations of CRYSTALS-KYBER. IAV is not responsible for possible infringements of third party rights.

## MISRA

QuantumSAR and the post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are checked with the 2012 version of [MISRA](https://misra.org.uk/app/uploads/2021/06/MISRA-C-2012-Permits-First-Edition.pdf).
